- Update your-package-name in package.json and other files to reflect your package
- Update bin/* to reflect the cmd command you want, and update that in package.json bin
- Setup git repo and add github actions as coverall-github-action-workflow (copy and paste is fine, but can modify if you want)
- Fill in readme
- Add files to src/* for your package
- Make sure to use .js extensions for all imports, since this has esm and cjs outputs
- .gitignore is already setup for you, but add any other files you want
- modify the typescript config in config/* and choose respective file
- esModuleInterp is off in tsconfig, this is becaeuse this is a package, and if on any other package that uses this needs to have it enabled too
